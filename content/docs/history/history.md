# History of Bundling Web Applications

During the initial stages of the Internet, the web functioned primarily as a file delivery platform. Over time, the web evolved from basic HTML pages to dynamic and interactive web applications powered by CSS and JavaScript. This shift from simple static webpages to complex, multi-component, and responsive applications created the need for bundling tools.

The following timeline outlines the emergence of various bundling tools and the unique features they introduced to the web development ecosystem.

## Early Days of Bundling

One of the first bundling tools was **Browserify**, launched in 2011. Interestingly, Browserify wasn’t originally designed to address bundling but to help Node.js developers reuse their code in the browser.

## [**Browserify**](https://browserify.org/)

Browserify was the first JavaScript bundler. It bundled different scripts from npm by parsing `require` statements in the code. While it excelled at bundling scripts, it lacked advanced code transformation capabilities.

Over time, Browserify progressed by integrating plugins and transforming libraries like Babelify, enabling modern JavaScript syntax support and simplifying workflows.

## [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

**Webpack**, created by Tobias Koppers, was first released in 2012. It has since become one of the most popular bundlers in the web development community. While Browserify aimed to run Node.js modules in the browser, Webpack aimed to create a comprehensive dependency graph for all website assets, including JavaScript, CSS, images, and HTML.

### Key Features:

- **Dependency Graph**: Handles multiple asset types.
- **Code Splitting**: Enables smaller bundles and prioritized resource loading.
- **Steep Learning Curve**: Despite its complexity, Webpack remains a popular tool due to its powerful features.

Webpack evolved by incorporating extensive plugin ecosystems, advanced module federation, and better performance optimization techniques.

## [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

Released in 2017, **Parcel** is an open-source project designed to simplify the complexities of traditional bundlers with a zero-configuration approach.

### Key Features:

- **Ease of Use**: Minimal setup and easy to learn.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Updates code changes live in the browser without reloads.

Parcel’s simplicity and efficiency make it a compelling choice for modern web development, especially for beginners.

As Parcel progressed, it introduced enhanced caching mechanisms, improved plugin systems, and multi-target builds.

## [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)

**Rollup**, created by Rich Harris in 2015, was designed to simplify JavaScript application development by using ES modules.

### Key Features:

- **ES Module Support**: Embraces the ES6 module standard for cleaner code management.
- **Tree-Shaking**: Eliminates unused code for smaller output sizes.

By adopting ES modules, Rollup enabled developers to combine code from various libraries more effectively.

Rollup has advanced by supporting TypeScript, adding more plugin support, and integrating better development workflows for modern frameworks like Svelte.

## [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)

Released in 2020 by Evan Wallace, **EsBuild** is written in Go and designed for highly parallelized build processes, leveraging all available CPU cores for optimization.

### Key Features:

- **Lightning-Fast Builds**: Orders of magnitude faster than traditional bundlers.
- **Bundling & Minification**: Reduces output file sizes efficiently.

Though relatively new, EsBuild has gained attention due to its exceptional performance and modern features.

EsBuild has evolved by expanding support for popular frameworks, plugins, and better developer tooling integration.

## [Relevant Standards](https://tc39.es/)

JavaScript, used alongside HTML and CSS, has evolved under the **ECMAScript (ES)** standard. Since 2015, annual updates have introduced new features to the language. **ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)** marked a major advancement with features like modules, which influenced modern bundlers like Rollup and EsBuild.

Bundling tools continue to evolve, shaping modern web development with faster build processes, modular code management, and reduced file sizes. These innovations play a critical role in delivering responsive and efficient web applications.
