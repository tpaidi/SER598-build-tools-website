# **Introduction to the Rollup section of the tutorial**

Rollup is a fantastic **module bundler** designed for modern JavaScript applications. It takes all your app's modules, compiles them, and optimizes assets like JavaScript and CSS. The result? A streamlined format that's ready to be deployed on the web.

What makes Rollup stand out is its use of **ES6 modules**, which helps create smaller and more efficient bundles. With a feature called **tree-shaking**, it automatically removes any unused code, so you're only shipping what's necessary.

**In the following module**, we will start simple and progressively deep dive into the inefficiencies of **not using Rollup**. Weâ€™ll explore how **Rollup addresses these challenges** by managing modules, optimizing bundles, and improving app performance.

**In the upcoming sections**, we'll start with some basic examples and gradually explore the features provided by Rollup. You'll see how **Rollup manages modules effectively**, optimizes bundles, and boosts your app's performance.

**So, are you ready to dive in? Let's get rolling!** ðŸš€

#### Note:
Before we begin, make sure you have `Node.js` and `npm` installed.
