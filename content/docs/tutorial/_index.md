# Overview & Learning Outcomes

## Tutorial Overview

In the rapidly evolving landscape of web development, managing complex applications has become increasingly challenging. As web applications grow in complexity, developers face significant hurdles in file management, performance optimization, and code organization. This comprehensive tutorial is designed to demystify web bundlers and equip you with the essential skills to streamline your web development workflow.

### Why Web Bundlers Matter

Modern web applications can quickly balloon to contain over 100 individual files, creating a maze of dependencies, performance bottlenecks, and maintenance nightmares. Web bundlers emerge as powerful solutions, transforming the way we develop, optimize, and deploy web applications.

### What You'll Discover

By the end of this tutorial, you'll transform from a developer struggling with unoptimized file management to a proficient build tool expert, capable of creating efficient, performant web applications. This tutorial will also leave you with some more resources to help you continue learning and help you delve deeper into web bundlers/ build tools.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Evaluate** the historical context and development of web bundlers, analyzing the challenges they address in modern web development.

2. **Formulate** an understanding of the limitations of using separate, unoptimized files in vanilla web applications, (the number of these files may scale over a 100 files in larger projects) and propose bundler solutions.

3. **Construct** a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating the challenges associated with managing multiple files.

4. **Configure** Webpack and Rollup, applying bundler settings to optimize and transform a basic web application.

5. **Optimize** the application's performance by employing techniques such as minification, tree-shaking, and bundling with Webpack and Rollup.

6. **Critique** the effectiveness of Webpack and Rollup in solving real-world problems, comparing their features and suitability for various project types.

7. **Develop** a deeper understanding of advanced bundler features by exploring additional reading materials, enabling further independent learning and application.

### **Prerequisite Knowledge**

This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge of the below web tools and technologies

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Emphasising that you should have built a couple of web applications using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript!
